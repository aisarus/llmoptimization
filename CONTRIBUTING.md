# Contributing

Thanks for improving the Laeda EFM++ Prompt Pack.

## Principles
- Keep prompts small, auditable, and measurable.
- Avoid organization-specific jargon, secrets, and private data.
- Prefer examples over long prose.

## How to contribute
1. Open an Issue describing the problem and the expected before/after.
2. Fork the repo and create a branch: `feat/<short-name>`.
3. Add or modify prompts/checklists/examples with minimal diffs.
4. Update `DecisionLog:` in files you touch.
5. Open a PR linking to the Issue; include a screenshot or text diff.

## Review checklist
- [ ] Role, Output, Constraints, Acceptance present
- [ ] Token budget stated; answers fit budget
- [ ] Examples added/updated
- [ ] No private data
